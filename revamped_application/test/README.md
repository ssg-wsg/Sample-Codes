# Tests

This folder contains the different unit tests and checkstyle tests that are used for CI/CD purposes.

You may freely extend or remove the test cases (spare for the checkstyle cases) as you see fit, but make sure that
new test code adheres to the `unittest` framework.

Also make sure that your tests are located within the [tests](revamped_application/tests) folder, and that they 
implement the `unittest` framework (inherit from `unittest.TestCase`).
