# Introduction

This repository contains sample codes (Encryption Decryption, Java, Node.js and Python) to guide and support your
application development on SSG-WSG Developer Portal (https://developer.ssg-wsg.gov.sg).

This repository also contains sample applications that you can use to test the different SSG-WSG APIs.

## [Sample Application](SSG-API-Testing-Application)

This is the first iteration of the Sample Application. It is built on Python using Tkinter and is only compatible with
Windows.

## [Sample Application v2](SSG-API-Testing-Application-v2)

This is the second iteration of the Sample Application. It is built on Python using Streamlit and is compatible with 
any platform that can install and execute Python 3.12 scripts.

It is also a web application that can be easily deployed to any cloud services such as AWS.

> ❗ For new users, you should use the new version of the Sample Application as it provides the most compatibility
> with your systems and has the most updated features to help you experiment with SSG-WSG's APIs!
